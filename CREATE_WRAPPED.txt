-- There are several methods for “wrapping” source code

-- You should be able to see the source code for the procedure,
-- including the embedded key (that needs to be kept secure).



-- Step 2: Create a simple function that echoes the stored key
-- embedded in the source code, so we can easily query the key.
-- This procedure is just a short bit of code that we can use
-- as an example for the wrapping procedures.
